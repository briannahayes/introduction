Hello everyone!

My name is Brianna Hayes. I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When I'm not making basketball brackets, I'm working on completing a double major in Political Science and Communications with a minor in Data Science.

I think of myself as a problem solver, and through my education, I've found a love for doing so with technology. For a career, I am interested in data analytics, data management, and developing technology solutions that allow business operations to prosper. However, I am still quite early on in my career and am still finding my path.

I look forward to meeting everyone and expanding our skillsets together!
